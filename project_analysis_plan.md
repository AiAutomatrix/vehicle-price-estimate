# Project Analysis Plan

**I. Project Setup and Overview**

1.  **List Files and Directories:** Use `list_files` with `recursive: true` to get a complete file listing. This provides a bird's-eye view of the project structure.
2.  **Examine Key Files:** Use `read_file` to examine the following files:
    *   `package.json`:  To understand dependencies and scripts.
    *   `src/App.js`:  The main application component and routing logic.
    *   `src/index.js`:  The entry point of the application.
    *   `src/routes.js` (if it exists): To understand the routing configuration.
    *   `src/context/AppContext.jsx`: To understand the global state management.
3.  **List Code Definitions:** Use `list_code_definition_names` on the `src` directory to get a high-level overview of the components, functions, and classes.

**II. Component Deep Dive**

1.  **Identify Key Components:** Based on the file listing and code definitions, identify the most important components (e.g., VehicleForm, ValuationResults, History, etc.).
2.  **Read Component Files:** Use `read_file` to examine the code of each key component. Pay attention to:
    *   Props and state variables.
    *   Lifecycle methods or hooks (e.g., `useEffect`).
    *   Event handlers.
    *   Rendering logic.
    *   Interactions with other components.
3.  **Analyze Component Interactions:** Understand how components interact with each other by tracing the flow of data and events.

**III. Data Flow Analysis**

1.  **Examine Context Providers:** If the application uses React Context, examine the context providers (e.g., `src/context/AppContext.jsx`) to understand how global state is managed.
2.  **Trace Data Fetching:** Identify where data is fetched from APIs (e.g., using `src/utils/api.js`) and how the data is used in the components.
3.  **Understand Form Handling:** Analyze how forms are handled (e.g., in `src/pages/VehicleForm.jsx`) and how the form data is processed.

**IV. Page Logic Flow**

1.  **Trace User Interactions:** For each page, trace the user interactions and how they trigger state updates, data fetching, or navigation.
2.  **Understand Navigation:** Analyze how the application navigates between pages using `react-router-dom`.
3.  **Identify Side Effects:** Identify any side effects (e.g., API calls, local storage updates) that occur as a result of user interactions or component updates.

**V. Documentation and Notes**

1.  **Create Documentation:** Create a markdown file (e.g., `project_analysis.md`) to document the findings.
2.  **Add Diagrams:** Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize component interactions, data flow, and page logic.
3.  **Take Notes:** Take detailed notes on the purpose of each component, the data flow, and any potential areas for improvement or refactoring.

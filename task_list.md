Determine Technical Debt: Identify any technical debt, such as outdated dependencies, inefficient code, or areas where refactoring is needed.
Task List: Designing the New UI
Create a Wireframe: Create a wireframe for each screen (Home, Image Analysis, Valuation Results, History & Saved Reports, Settings/Profile) to visualize the new UI.
Develop a Color Scheme: Create a cool-toned color scheme (blues, grays, whites) for a professional automotive feel.
Design Icons: Design icons for actions like upload, scan, history, and settings.
Create a Design System: Establish a design system to ensure consistency throughout the app, including typography, spacing, and layout.
